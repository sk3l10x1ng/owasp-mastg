Given that most news is already shared via OWASP Slack over the last quarter, we still see that it is good to share a summary of all of the good things outside of Slack using this news section. In this update we have a lot to share! While we started off this year with an improved version of the MASVS and MSTG, things have not been quiet: there has been a huge development in master of the MSTG and many issues have been raised and fixed. In the meantime, we have worked on an actual print of the book!

While an early version is available through Hulu (no link supplied, google and buy at your own risk), we are working on making a better version of that book. In the mean time we have filed for a project promotion to Flagship! Next a lot more cool things happened: with the now official publication of [NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-163 Revision 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2019/nist-publishes-sp-800-163-rev-1), the MASVS and MSTG are getting more mainstream ;-).

The MASVS & MSTG are mentioned in various other upcoming programs/standards/recommendations as well, which is really a recognition of the hard work put in by the community. We are proud to be part of such a great project! Next, we are preparing to join the Open Security Summit again! Already three people will be on site, and at least one remote, but we would love to work with more people at the project again! Want to know more?
