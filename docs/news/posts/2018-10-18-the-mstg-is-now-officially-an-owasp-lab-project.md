During AppSec US 2018 in San Jose the Mobile Security Testing Guide was reviewed by several volunteers to assess the maturity of the project. As a result our request for project graduation to lab status was granted. The reviews can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1WiHln8igTE5noquodwWCo_VuRmvnpQtEhGV6z-P37EU/edit?usp=drive_web).

Thanks to Harold Blankenship for organising the project review event during AppSec US and for pushing things forward for all the OWASP projects and of course to all people that took the effort to review our project!
