We have been awarded Flagship status! We are very grateful and excited about this! We could not have done this without our team of awesome volunteers that have committed to the project, wrote issues, and supported us in many other ways. A special thanks goes out to OWASP and especially Harold Blankenship for facilitating us to function as a project and for leading the project review at OWASP Appsec Tel-Aviv! Thank you!
