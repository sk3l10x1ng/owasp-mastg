The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) launched the ["Safe App Standard"](https://www.csa.gov.sg/News-Events/Press-Releases/2024/csa-publishes-recommended-standard-for-more-secure-transactions-made-via-mobile-applications) on January 10, 2024. Tailored for local app developers and service providers, this guideline is based on the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) and focuses on critical areas such as authentication and authorization (MASVS-AUTH), data storage (MASVS-STORAGE), and tamper resistance (MASVS-RESILIENCE). The initiative aims to protect apps from common cyber threats and ensure a safer digital space for users.

While the Safe App Standard is a significant step forward in securing mobile applications, developers are encouraged to consider the [full MASVS](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/) and select the appropriate MAS profiles for comprehensive protection. This holistic approach to app security ensures that apps go beyond meeting the baseline and are protected against a wider range of cyber threats, providing robust security for end users.
