draft:
  description: e.g. calling startActivity, startService, sendBroadcast, or setResult
    on untrusted Intents without validating or sanitizing these Intents. Using an
    implicit intent to start a service is a security hazard, because you can't be
    certain what service will respond to the intent and the user can't see which service
    starts. e.g. mutable pending intents (not using FLAG_IMMUTABLE), replaying pending
    intents (not using FLAG_ONE_SHOT)
