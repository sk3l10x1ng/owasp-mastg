title: Use ProGuard to Remove Logging Code
platform: android
---

While preparing the production release, you can use tools like @MASTG-TOOL-0022 (included in Android Studio). To determine whether all logging functions from the `android.util.Log` class have been removed, check the ProGuard configuration file (proguard-rules.pro) for the following options (according to this [example of removing logging code](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard/manual/examples#logging "ProGuard\'s example of removing logging code") and this article about [enabling ProGuard in an Android Studio project](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#enable "Android Developer - Enable shrinking, obfuscation, and optimization")):

```default
-assumenosideeffects class android.util.Log
{
  public static boolean isLoggable(java.lang.String, int);
  public static int v(...);
  public static int i(...);
  public static int w(...);
  public static int d(...);
  public static int e(...);
  public static int wtf(...);
}
```

Note that the example above only ensures that calls to the Log class' methods will be removed. If the string that will be logged is dynamically constructed, the code that constructs the string may remain in the bytecode. For example, the following code issues an implicit `StringBuilder` to construct the log statement:

Example in Java:

```java
Log.v("Private key tag", "Private key [byte format]: " + key);
```

Example in Kotlin:

```kotlin
Log.v("Private key tag", "Private key [byte format]: $key")
```

The compiled bytecode, however, is equivalent to the bytecode of the following log statement, which constructs the string explicitly:

Example in Java:

```java
Log.v("Private key tag", new StringBuilder("Private key [byte format]: ").append(key.toString()).toString());
```

Example in Kotlin:

```kotlin
Log.v("Private key tag", StringBuilder("Private key [byte format]: ").append(key).toString())
```

ProGuard guarantees removal of the `Log.v` method call. Whether the rest of the code (`new StringBuilder ...`) will be removed depends on the complexity of the code and the [ProGuard version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6009078/removing-unused-strings-during-proguard-optimisation "Removing unused strings during ProGuard optimization ").

This is a security risk because the (unused) string leaks plain text data into memory, which can be accessed via a debugger or memory dumping.

Unfortunately, no silver bullet exists for this issue, but one option would be to implement a custom logging facility that takes simple arguments and constructs the log statements internally.

```java
SecureLog.v("Private key [byte format]: ", key);
```

Then configure ProGuard to strip its calls.
