title: Runtime Tracing of Permission API Calls with Frida
code: [swift]
id: MASTG-DEMO-0x69-3
test: MASTG-TEST-0x69-3
---

### Sample

The following sample code below requests access to protected resources requiring permissions.

{{ ../MASTG-DEMO-0x69/MastgTest.swift }}

### Steps

1. Install the app on a device (@MASTG-TECH-0056).
2. Make sure you have @MASTG-TOOL-0039 installed on your machine and the frida-server running on the device.
3. Run `run.sh` to spawn the app with Frida and load the permission tracing script.
4. Interact with the app to trigger permission requests (e.g., tap **Request All Permissions** button).
5. Stop the script by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

{{ run.sh # script.js }}

### Observation

The output reveals runtime permission API calls including:

- **Permission checks**: Calls to methods like `authorizationStatusForMediaType:`, `authorizationStatusForEntityType:`, and `CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus`.
- **Permission requests**: Calls to methods like `requestAccessForMediaType:completionHandler:`, `requestWhenInUseAuthorization`, and `requestAuthorizationWithOptions:completionHandler:`.
- **Permission status**: The granted/denied status returned by the system for each permission type.

### Evaluation

The test fails because the app requests excessive permissions at runtime not justified by its core functionality. The output confirms the following permissions are actively requested and granted:

- **Location** — requests both `WhenInUse` and `Always` authorization
- **Camera** — granted access
- **Microphone** — granted access
- **Contacts** — granted access
- **Calendar** — granted access
- **HealthKit** — granted access
- **Motion** — granted access
- **PhotoLibrary** — granted access
- **Notifications** — granted access

This confirms that the statically declared permissions in `Info.plist` and entitlements are actually exercised during app execution.
