title: Declaring Sensitive Permissions in entitlements.plist
code: [swift]
id: MASTG-DEMO-0x69-2
test: MASTG-TEST-0x69-2
---

### Sample

The code snippet below shows sample code that accesses protected resources requiring entitlements. The app's `entitlements.plist` file declares multiple permissions that the app uses to request special access.

{{ ../MASTG-DEMO-0x69/MastgTest.swift }}

### Steps

1. Unzip the app package and locate the main app binary (@MASTG-TECH-0058), which in this case is `./Payload/MASTestApp.app/MASTestApp`.
2. Run `run.sh` to extract the entitlements.

{{ run.sh }}

### Observation

The output reveals the entitlements plist extracted from the app binary's code signature, listing all capabilities embedded during the signing process.

{{ output.txt }}

### Evaluation

The test fails because the app binary embeds entitlements that are excessive for its core functionality. Specifically:

- `com.apple.developer.healthkit` — health data access
- `com.apple.developer.homekit` — smart home device control
- `com.apple.developer.siri` — Siri integration
- `com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.formats` — NFC reader access (NDEF, TAG)
- `com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info` — Wi-Fi network information
- `get-task-allow` — debugger attachment (should be disabled in production builds)
