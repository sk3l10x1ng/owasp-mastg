### Sample

The following code implements immediate in-app updates using the Google Play Core API by calling `startUpdateFlowForResult` with `AppUpdateOptions.newBuilder(1)`.

{{ MastgTest.kt # MastgTest_reversed.java }}

### Steps

Let's run @MASTG-TOOL-0110 rules against the sample code.

{{ ../../../../rules/mastg-android-enforced-updating.yml }}

{{ run.sh }}

### Observation

The output file shows usages of the Google Play Core API enforcing immediate update.

{{ output.txt }}

### Evaluation

The test passes because the app forces users to update the application immediately and does not provide a fallback.
