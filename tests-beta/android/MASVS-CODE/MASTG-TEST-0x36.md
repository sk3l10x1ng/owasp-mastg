## Overview

If the app does not properly enforce mandatory updates, users may continue running outdated versions that contain known security vulnerabilities or deprecated functionality. This can lead to exploitation of patched vulnerabilities, data leakage, or incompatibility with backend security requirements.

On Android, mandatory updates can be implemented using the [Google Play Core In-App Update API](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/kotlin-java) by invoking `startUpdateFlowForResult` with `AppUpdateType.IMMEDIATE` (value `1`). However, simply calling `startUpdateFlowForResult` is insufficient — users can dismiss the update dialog or background the app before the update completes. Without additional enforcement in the `onResume` lifecycle method to detect `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` or `DEVELOPER_TRIGGERED_UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS` states, the mandatory update can be trivially bypassed.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0014 to identify calls to the Play Core In-App Update API, specifically `startUpdateFlowForResult` configured with the integer value `1` (`AppUpdateType.IMMEDIATE`).
2. Review the code to verify that the app checks for pending updates in its `onResume` lifecycle method by calling `appUpdateManager.appUpdateInfo` and handling both `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` and `DEVELOPER_TRIGGERED_UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS` states.

## Observation

The output should contain:

- Locations where `startUpdateFlowForResult` with `AppUpdateOptions.newBuilder(1).build()` is called.
- Evidence of update enforcement logic in `onResume` that checks `updateAvailability()` and re-triggers the update flow when an update is still pending.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if:

- The app does not implement enforced updating using Play In-App Updates API.
- The app calls `startUpdateFlowForResult` with `AppUpdateType.IMMEDIATE` but does not implement proper `onResume` checks to prevent users from bypassing the update by dismissing the dialog.
