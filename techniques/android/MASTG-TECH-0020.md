title: Retrieving Cross References
platform: android

## Java and Kotlin

There are many RE tools that support retrieving Java cross references. For many of the GUI-based ones, this is usually done by right clicking on the desired function and selecting the corresponding option, e.g. **Show References to** in Ghidra or [**Find Usage**](https://github.com/skylot/jadx/wiki/jadx-gui-features-overview#find-usage "jadx - find-usage") in @MASTG-TOOL-0018.

## Native Code

Similarly to Java analysis, you can also use Ghidra to analyze native libraries and obtain cross references by right clicking the desired function and selecting **Show References to**.
