title: Accessing App Data Directories
platform: ios

Once you have installed the app, there is further information to explore. Let's go through a short overview of the app folder structure on iOS apps to understand which data is stored where. The following illustration represents the application folder structure:

On iOS, system applications can be found in the `/Applications` directory while user-installed apps are available under `/private/var/containers/`. However, finding the right folder just by navigating the file system is not a trivial task as every app gets a random 128-bit UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) assigned for its directory names.

In order to easily obtain the installation directory information for user-installed apps you can follow the following methods:

Connect to the terminal on the device and run the command `ipainstaller` ([IPA Installer Console](https://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.autopear.installipa "IPA Installer Console")) to install @MASTG-APP-0028 as follows:

```bash
iPhone:~ root# ipainstaller -l
...
OWASP.iGoat-Swift

iPhone:~ root# ipainstaller -i OWASP.iGoat-Swift
...
Bundle: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/3ADAF47D-A734-49FA-B274-FBCA66589E67
Application: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/3ADAF47D-A734-49FA-B274-FBCA66589E67/iGoat-Swift.app
Data: /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/8C8E7EB0-BC9B-435B-8EF8-8F5560EB0693
```

Using objection's command `env` will also show you all the directory information of the app. Connecting to the application with objection is described in @MASTG-TOOL-0074. In this case we're connecting to @MASTG-APP-0028:

```bash
OWASP.iGoat-Swift on (iPhone: 11.1.2) [usb] # env

Name               Path
-----------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BundlePath         /var/containers/Bundle/Application/3ADAF47D-A734-49FA-B274-FBCA66589E67/iGoat-Swift.app
CachesDirectory    /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/8C8E7EB0-BC9B-435B-8EF8-8F5560EB0693/Library/Caches
DocumentDirectory  /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/8C8E7EB0-BC9B-435B-8EF8-8F5560EB0693/Documents
LibraryDirectory   /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/8C8E7EB0-BC9B-435B-8EF8-8F5560EB0693/Library
```

As you can see, apps have two main locations:

- The Bundle directory (`/var/containers/Bundle/Application/3ADAF47D-A734-49FA-B274-FBCA66589E67/`).
- The Data directory (`/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/8C8E7EB0-BC9B-435B-8EF8-8F5560EB0693/`).

These folders contain information that must be examined closely during application security assessments (for example when analyzing the stored data for sensitive data).

Bundle directory:

- **AppName.app**
    - This is the Application Bundle as seen before in the IPA, it contains essential application data, static content as well as the application's compiled binary.
    - This directory is visible to users, but users can't write to it.
    - Content in this directory is not backed up.
    - The contents of this folder are used to validate the code signature.

Data directory:

- **Documents/**
    - Contains all the user-generated data. The application end user initiates the creation of this data.
    - Visible to users and users can write to it.
    - Content in this directory is backed up.
    - The app can disable paths by setting `NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey`.
- **Library/**
    - Contains all files that aren't user-specific, such as caches, preferences, cookies, and property list (plist) configuration files.
    - iOS apps usually use the `Application Support` and `Caches` subdirectories, but the app can create custom subdirectories.
- **Library/Caches/**
    - Contains semi-persistent cached files.
    - Invisible to users and users can't write to it.
    - Content in this directory is not backed up.
    - The OS may delete this directory's files automatically when the app is not running and storage space is running low.
- **Library/Application Support/**
    - Contains persistent files necessary for running the app.
    - Invisible to users and users can't write to it.
    - Content in this directory is backed up.
    - The app can disable paths by setting `NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey`.
- **Library/Preferences/**
    - Used for storing properties that can persist even after an application is restarted.
    - Information is saved, unencrypted, inside the application sandbox in a plist file called [BUNDLE_ID].plist.
    - All the key/value pairs stored using `NSUserDefaults` can be found in this file.
- **tmp/**
    - Use this directory to write temporary files that do not need to persist between app launches.
    - Contains non-persistent cached files.
    - Invisible to users.
    - Content in this directory is not backed up.
    - The OS may delete this directory's files automatically when the app is not running and storage space is running low.

Let's take a closer look at iGoat-Swift's Application Bundle (.app) directory inside the Bundle directory (`/var/containers/Bundle/Application/3ADAF47D-A734-49FA-B274-FBCA66589E67/iGoat-Swift.app`):

You can also visualize the Bundle directory from @MASTG-TOOL-0061 by clicking on **Finder** -> **Bundle**:

Including the `Info.plist` file:
