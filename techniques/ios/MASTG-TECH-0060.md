Many apps log informative (and potentially sensitive) messages to the console log. The log also contains crash reports and other useful information. You can collect console logs through the Xcode **Devices** window as follows:

1. Launch Xcode.
2. Connect your device to your host computer.
3. Choose **Window** -> **Devices and Simulators**.
4. Click on your connected iOS device in the left section of the Devices window.
5. Reproduce the problem.
6. Click on the **Open Console** button located in the upper right-hand area of the Devices window to view the console logs on a separate window.

To save the console output to a text file, go to the top right side of the Console window and click on the **Save** button.

You can also connect to the device shell as explained in @MASTG-TECH-0052, install socat via apt-get and run the following command:

```bash
iPhone:~ root# socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/lockdown/syslog.sock
