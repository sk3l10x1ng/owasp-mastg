[Bytecode Viewer](https://bytecodeviewer.com/ "Bytecode Viewer") (BCV) is a free and open source Java decompiler framework running on all operating systems. It is a versatile tool which can be used to decompile Android apps, view APK resources (via apktool) and easily edit APKs (via Smali/Baksmali). Apart from APKs, also DEX, Java Class files and Java Jars can be viewed. One of its major features is the support for multiple Java bytecode decompilers under one GUI. BCV currently includes the Procyon, CFR, Fernflower, Krakatau, and JADX-Core decompilers. These decompilers have different strengths and can be easily leveraged while using BCV, especially when dealing with obfuscated programs.
