Busybox combines multiple common Unix utilities into a small single executable. The utilities included generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU counterparts, but are sufficient enough to provide a complete environment on a small or embedded system. Busybox can be installed on a rooted device by downloading the Busybox application from Google Play Store. You can also download the binary directly from the [Busybox website](https://busybox.net "Busybox Website"). Once downloaded, make an `adb push busybox /data/local/tmp` to have the executable available on your phone. A quick overview of how to install and use Busybox can be found in the [Busybox FAQ](https://busybox.net/FAQ.html#getting_started "Busybox FAQ").
