The [reFlutter](https://github.com/Impact-I/reFlutter) framework helps to reverse engineer Flutter apps using the patched version of the Flutter library, which is already compiled and ready for application repackaging. This library has a modified snapshot deserialization process that allows you to perform dynamic analysis.

You can install and use reFlutter by following [the official instructions](https://github.com/Impact-I/reFlutter?tab=readme-ov-file#install). More information is also available in the article ["Fork Bomb for Flutter"](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/fork-bomb-for-flutter/) including details and practical examples.
