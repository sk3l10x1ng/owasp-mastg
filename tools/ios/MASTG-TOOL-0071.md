After installing @MASTG-TOOL-0070, in order to make all development tools available systemwide, it is recommended to install the Xcode Command Line Tools package. This will be handy during testing of iOS apps as some of the tools (e.g. objection) are also relying on the availability of this package. You can [download it from the official Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ "Apple iOS SDK") or install it straight away from your terminal:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
